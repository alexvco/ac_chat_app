    # We'll send over this JSON object, and so the server side will receive that in
    # app/channels/chatrooms_channel.rb

    # So this @perform is calling send_message and we'll have some data that we receive which will be this JSON object here. 
    # We'll have this set up so that we can perform that send message function server side, and we can just pass that data over, 
    # and ActionCable is going to know what to do, it will convert it to the ruby function. 
    # It will call that function, it will execute that server side and do whatever you want. 
    # That means all we have to do now is:

    # application.js

      #  App.chatrooms.send_message(chatroom_id, body.val())
